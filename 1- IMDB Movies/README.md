# Introduction
The goal of the project is to analyze the popularity of movies based on a set of data. I used the Kaggle competition "Popular Movies of IMDb" (see https://www.kaggle.com/sankha1998/tmdb-top-10000-popular-movies-dataset) to retrieve necessary data. Mainly to answer the following two questions:

### Research Question 1: Which genres are most popular from year to year?
### Research Question 2: What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
