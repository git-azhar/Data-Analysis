# Titanic-Survival
The goal of the project was to predict the survival of passengers based on a set of data. I used the Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" (see https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) to retrieve necessary data and evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. The historical data has been split into two groups, a 'training set' and a 'test set'. We used this set to build our model to generate predictions for the test set.
