# Titanic-Survival
The goal of the project was to predict the survival of passengers based on a set of data. We used the Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" (see https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) to retrieve necessary data and evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. The historical data has been split into two groups, a 'training set' and a 'test set'. For the training set, we are provided with the outcome (whether or not a passenger survived). We used this set to build our model to
generate predictions for the test set.
